- Overfitting, underfitting
- Regularization
- Deep learning: learning data representations

- Bias-Variance Trade-off
    - Variance: does the model vary a lot if we change the training set?
    - Bias: is the average model close to the true solution?
    - Generalization: can be seen as the sum of the squared bias and variance
